If there are problems with starting the docker cluster, you are either going to have to get another ca.crt file from one of the docker container.

The command to get this ca to your folder would be: docker cp <docker-container name>:/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/certs/ca/ca.crt .
    For the docker container name use one of the three that start with elastic-search-es

You also need to set the max map count to 2262144:
    Linux: 
            grep vm.max_map_count /etc/sysctl.conf
            vm.max_map_count=262144

    Mac: 
        docker-machine ssh
        sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144

    Windows: 
        Same as on Mac if you use Docker Desktop

        With WSL 2 Backend:
        wsl -d docker-desktop
        sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
